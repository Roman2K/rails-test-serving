Tired of waitings 10 seconds before your tests run?

== Quick usage instructions

1.  Insert the following lines at the top of <tt>test/test_helper.rb</tt>, right after
    <tt>ENV["RAILS_ENV"] = "test"</tt>:
      ENV["RAILS_ENV"] = "test"
      
      require 'rails_test_serving'
      RailsTestServing.boot
      
      # ... rest of test_helper.rb

2.  Start the server:
      cd <project-dir>
      ruby test/test_helper.rb --serve

3.  Run tests as you usually do:
      ruby test/unit/account_test.rb
      ruby test/unit/account_test.rb -n /balance/
    As a consequence, they work in RubyMate too (âŒ˜R in TextMate).

== Notes

* The first run will be slow as Rails is loading. Subsequent runs will be fast.
* If the server is not started, tests fall back to running the usual way.

== Caveats

* Seems to cause trouble with integration tests. I really don't understand what is going between the
  two. From what I experienced so far, something really weird happens: after the first request inside
  a test, for example a <tt>get '/'</tt>, database records disappear.
* There might exist some quirks: search for "TODO" in the source. I can bear them
  but contributions are welcome.
* Some unit tests are left to be written.
